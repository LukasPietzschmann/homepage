<h1>University Work</h1>

<p>
	During my bachelor's and master's studies, I produced a variety of
	stuff. This, among others, includes slides, projects, papers, and theses.
	I compiled a little list of the more interesting things:
</p>
<Accordion name='Academic Work' open={true}>
	{#snippet head()}
		Academic Work (Theses, Paper)
	{/snippet}
	{#snippet details()}
		<CardList>
			<UniProjects data={academicWork} icon={faGraduationCap}/>
		</CardList>
	{/snippet}
</Accordion>
<Accordion name='Uni Projects'>
