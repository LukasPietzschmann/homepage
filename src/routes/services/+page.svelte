<p>
	I host all my services as Docker containers on a VPS at
	<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-umami-event="NetCup"
	   href="https://netcup.eu">NetCup</a>.
	Among these, only one is exposed to the public: Caddy. Because of that,
	everything &mdash; UDP/TCP packets and HTTP(s) requests &mdash; is routed
	through Caddy, which either forwards the packets/requests to the appropriate
	container or serves static files directly.
</p>
<p>
	To facilitate this setup, the Caddy container is configured to share a network with
	all service containers. However, for services requiring, e.g., a database (like
	NextCloud), the database remains inaccessible to Caddy. Instead, it is connected
	through a dedicated network shared exclusively between the service and the database
	container.
