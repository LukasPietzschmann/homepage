<p>
	I host all my services as Docker containers on a VPS at
	<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-umami-event="NetCup"
	   href="https://netcup.eu">NetCup</a>.
	Among these, only two containers are exposed to the public: Caddy and Minecraft.
	Connections to the Minecraft container are direct and not proxied or relayed. In
	contrast, all other requests are routed through Caddy, which either forwards them
	to the appropriate container or serves static files directly.
</p>
<p>
	To facilitate this setup, the Caddy container is configured to share a network with
	all service containers. However, for services requiring, e.g., a database (like
	NextCloud), the database remains inaccessible to Caddy. Instead, it is connected
	through a dedicated network shared exclusively between the service and the database
	container.
