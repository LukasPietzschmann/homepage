<p>Hey! You just stumbled over my little corner on the internet :)</p>
<p>
	I'm Lukas, a German computer science student based near Ulm and I'm
	currently studying for my master's degree at the
	<a href="https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/">University of Ulm</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I enjoy coding in all kinds of languages, but C and C++ (and TeX &#128521)
	are probably the ones I am most experienced with. While many different
	things spark my interest, you can always get my attention by talking about
	compilers, functional programming, and typesetting.
